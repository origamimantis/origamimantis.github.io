<br>
There exists a program that runs games, and in this program there is an option for connecting a controller via bluetooth.<br>
<br>
I wanted to use my old phone as a controller, so support was limited. First off, my phone did not support whatever protocol they were using. I tried some middleware, but my old phone was pretty bad and something wasn't compatible with the few apps that did work. In my opinion, bluetooth is also just a general hassle with all the pairing and discovery.<br>
<br>
So I made my own, with a video of its functionality (disclaimer: I own this game).<br>
This is an android 5 to ubuntu 18 wifi controller. Compatibility not guaranteed for other systems :)<br>

Available on my github!
