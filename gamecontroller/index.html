September 2022.<br>
<br>
There exists a program that runs games, and in this program there is an option for connecting a controller via bluetooth.<br>
<br>
I wanted to use my old phone as a controller, so support was limited. My phone did not support whatever protocol the controllers used, so that was off the table. I tried some middleware, but the phone was pretty dated so there were compatibility with the existing apps that did exist. In my opinion, bluetooth is also just a general hassle with all the pairing and discovery.<br>
<br>
So I made my own, with a video of its functionality (disclaimer: I own this game).<br>
This is an android 5 to ubuntu 18 wifi controller. Compatibility not guaranteed for other systems :)<br>
<br>
Available on my github!
